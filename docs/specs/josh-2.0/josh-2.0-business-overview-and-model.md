# JOSH Business Overview

## What JOSH Is

JOSH is a very well-connected, insightful friend you can text.

JOSH helps you turn "I want to do something this weekend" into "I met someone I actually clicked with." You text JOSH naturally, and JOSH responds like someone who knows you, understands your vibe, and has ideas.

JOSH learns who you are through an in-depth conversational interview that explores the factors that actually shape friend compatibility, not just what you like to do, but why you like it, how you prefer to connect, and what makes a friendship sustainable in your real life.

Then, instead of matching you with a profile to message, JOSH makes it easier to meet through a small group experience called a LinkUp.

This is still about meeting potential friends. The difference is the first step is doing something together.

## The Core Problem

Adults know how to make friends. The issue is the infrastructure for doing so has been systematically dismantled.

You can't just "put yourself out there" when:

* Every hobby group requires searching, comparing, committing to recurring schedules  
* Suggesting plans to acquaintances means days of coordination anxiety  
* Apps give you profiles to swipe but no path from match to real meeting  
* Social events are either massive (overwhelming) or intimate friend-groups (closed circles)

The friction is in the coordination, not the desire.

## The Consumer Promise

When you feel like doing something, skydiving, local concert, museum, trivia night, you should not have to:

* Scroll a feed hoping someone posted the exact thing you want  
* Pitch strangers on why they should meet you  
* Coordinate schedules across multiple people for days  
* Wonder if anyone will actually show up

JOSH handles the social friction so you can focus on the part you actually want: connection.

## Core Value Proposition

JOSH helps adults meet compatible friends by making it easy to join or initiate small social experiences, with the coordination handled for you.

### What You Get

People Who Actually Fit You  
JOSH matches for friend compatibility first, understanding not just what you like, but why you like it and how you prefer to connect. Then JOSH uses that understanding to decide who gets invited to each experience.

Less Effort, More Momentum  
One text to JOSH can lead to a confirmed plan with compatible people. No endless message threads, no coordination anxiety, no wondering if it will actually happen.

Lower-Pressure First Meetings  
Doing something together (hiking, coffee, trivia) is easier and more natural than forcing a "let's be friends" conversation with a stranger. The activity gives you something to do while connection happens naturally.

A Friend Who Remembers You  
The conversational interview captures nuance that typical profiles miss. JOSH understands your energy preferences, communication style, friendship values, and the practical realities of your life—then uses that to make better matches over time.

## How JOSH Works

### Registration and Profile Building

You register on the JOSH website with your phone number. After verification, JOSH sends you a text to begin the conversational interview.

The interview is natural, back-and-forth dialogue that explores:

* The activities you enjoy and why they appeal to you  
* How you prefer to connect with people (deep conversation vs activity-focused, small groups vs pairs)  
* Your energy and environment preferences (calm coffee shop vs buzzy brunch spot)  
* Your communication style and how you show care in friendships  
* Your values and what you're looking for in friendships right now  
* Practical realities (social capacity, timing preferences, boundaries)

JOSH signals progress as each dimension completes, so you know how far along you are. When complete, JOSH tells you your profile is ready and you have compatible matches available.

### Initiating a LinkUp

When you want to do something, you text JOSH naturally:

* "Is anyone free to grab coffee Saturday morning"  
* "I'm free this weekend and want to get outside"  
* "Looking for something chill on Friday evening"

JOSH responds by:

1. Understanding your intent (is this about deep conversation, casual company, energizing activity?)  
2. Confirming a simple time window (usually offering 2-3 options)  
3. Finding compatible people in your area who would be good matches  
4. Inviting them to join

### Accepting an Invite

You can also join LinkUps that others initiate. When a LinkUp is forming that fits your vibe, JOSH texts you:

* "Coffee Sunday morning in Capitol Hill \- Sarah and Mike are going, interested?"

You can accept or decline. If you accept, you're in. If the LinkUp fills up or the acceptance window closes, JOSH confirms whether it's happening.

### The LinkUp Itself

A LinkUp is a small social experience (2-10 people total) designed to make meeting easier.

Formation Process:

* JOSH invites a batch of compatible people simultaneously  
* 24-hour acceptance window  
* LinkUp locks when it hits 10 people (maximum) or when the window closes with at least 2 people confirmed  
* If only the initiator accepts and no one else joins, the LinkUp fails and JOSH lets them know honestly

Before the Event:

* Once locked, all confirmed participants can see each other's profile photos and names on the dashboard  
* JOSH sends a reminder the morning of the event  
* Everyone knows who's coming and where to meet

After the Event:

* Dashboard shows all attendees  
* Each person can choose whether to exchange contact info with each attendee  
* If both people select yes, real phone numbers are shared  
* If only one or neither selects yes, no exchange happens

This lets you control the pace of connection. You're not obligated to become friends with everyone, and privacy is protected until mutual interest is confirmed.

## The Matching System

### Understanding Intent and Context

JOSH doesn't just match based on what you like. JOSH understands why you like it and what you're looking for in the moment.

"I want to grab coffee" could mean:

* Seeking deep conversation and intimate connection  
* Need quiet company while working  
* Want to meet someone new with low pressure  
* Looking for energizing social time

"Let's go hiking" could mean:

* Training/fitness focused (achievement)  
* Nature therapy/decompression (restorative)  
* Adventure and challenge (stimulation)  
* Bonding through shared experience (connection)

JOSH captures these motivations and matches accordingly.

### The Activity Pattern Model

Every activity you mention is stored as an Activity Pattern:

Activity Pattern \= Activity \+ Motive \+ Interaction Style \+ Constraints

Example:

* Beach → Restorative motive \+ parallel/low-talk style \+ near-water, quiet areas  
* Beach → Achievement/stimulation motives \+ activity-first style \+ in-water, early morning

The same activity can mean completely different things to different people. JOSH captures that nuance.

### Motive Categories

JOSH uses a universal set of motivations that work across all activities:

* Restorative: calm, decompress, nature therapy  
* Connection: deep talk, bonding, real conversation  
* Play: light, fun, laughter  
* Exploration: new places, novelty, curiosity  
* Achievement: training, progress, performance  
* Stimulation: energy, excitement, challenge  
* Belonging: community, feeling included, group identity  
* Focus: co-working, parallel productivity  
* Comfort: easy, familiar, low-effort

### Interaction Style Dimensions

How you prefer to connect:

* Talk-heavy ↔ Activity-first ↔ Parallel hang  
* Deep conversation ↔ Light conversation  
* One-on-one ↔ Small group ↔ Larger group  
* Slow-burn bonding ↔ Fast bonding  
* Familiar routine ↔ Novelty seeking

### Two-Part Compatibility Score

When forming a LinkUp, JOSH calculates:

Friend Compatibility (stable baseline)  
 Alignment across motive patterns, interaction styles, communication preferences, values, and practical constraints. This is who you'd generally get along with as a friend.

Moment Fit (situational multiplier)  
 For this specific LinkUp, does it match your current intent, timing preferences, and activity patterns? Are you in the right headspace for this right now?

Final invitation score \= Friend Compatibility × Moment Fit

This ensures people are compatible as potential friends and that the specific experience fits everyone's current state.

### Learning Over Time

JOSH gets smarter by tracking:

* Which invites you accept or decline  
* Which activities and timing patterns work for you  
* Whether you attend confirmed LinkUps  
* Whether you do repeat LinkUps with the same people

This refines your activity patterns, motive weights, and interaction preferences without asking more questions. The system learns from your behavior.

## Business Model

### Revenue Model: Monthly Subscription

People aren't paying for text messages. They're paying for outcomes: the ease of getting out, meeting compatible people, and building a real social life.

### What the Subscription Unlocks

* The ability to initiate LinkUps  
* The ability to accept invitations to LinkUps  
* Full coordination and RSVP handling  
* Access to the dashboard with confirmed attendees  
* Post-event contact exchange

### Why Subscription Fits

The value compounds over time:

* JOSH learns you better with each interaction  
* The habit is recurring (weekends, social needs happen regularly)  
* It supports ongoing real-world connection rather than one-off transactions

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Region-First Rollout

JOSH launches in focused geographic areas to ensure enough people for good outcomes.

* Launch in one city with concentrated effort  
* Waitlist everywhere else  
* Open a new region only when there's enough interest to create reliable LinkUp experiences

This prevents the "ghost town" problem where users can't find matches because density is too low.

### The Conversion Moment

The paywall appears at the point of highest intent: after the interview is complete, when the user has expressed what they want to do, and JOSH is ready to coordinate.

This is when the value is most clear and immediate.

## Key Features

### SMS-First Interaction

Everything starts with a text. No app to open, no interface to learn. JOSH meets you where you already are.

### Conversational Interview

Natural dialogue that explores 10+ compatibility dimensions without feeling like a survey. JOSH asks follow-up questions based on your responses and signals progress throughout.

### Friend-Compatibility Matching

Sophisticated psychological matching that goes beyond surface preferences to understand motivations, interaction styles, and life context.

### LinkUps

Small group experiences (2-10 people) that reduce the pressure of one-on-one meetings while creating natural opportunities for connection.

### Simple Timing Windows

JOSH offers 2-3 clear options instead of endless back-and-forth scheduling. You pick, others RSVP, JOSH handles the rest.

### Privacy-First Contact Exchange

You control when and with whom you share your real contact info. Numbers are only shared after mutual selection following an event.

### Honest Communication

JOSH never fakes momentum. If a LinkUp doesn't fill, JOSH tells you directly and offers to try different timing or activities.

### Safety and Trust Controls

Clear boundaries, crisis detection protocols, and safe handling for sensitive situations. Quality over growth metrics.

## MVP Launch Goals

The MVP is built to prove one thing:

Adults will pay for a reliable way to meet compatible friends in real life, without the planning hassle.

The signature win JOSH aims to deliver repeatedly:

1. User completes the conversational interview  
2. JOSH offers a simple, appropriate next-step experience  
3. User subscribes to unlock coordination  
4. JOSH successfully forms a LinkUp  
5. User attends and meets someone they actually like  
6. User initiates or accepts another LinkUp

## Success Metrics

MVP-level metrics that matter:

* Interview completion rate  
* Intent expression rate (users who say they want to do something)  
* Subscription conversion after intent expression  
* LinkUp lock success rate (formations that reach minimum attendance)  
* Attendance confirmation rate  
* Repeat LinkUps per subscriber per month  
* Contact exchange rate post-event

## Differentiation

### JOSH vs Traditional Friendship Apps

Traditional apps: Swipe profiles, message strangers, coordinate on your own  
 JOSH: Compatibility-first matching, coordination handled, meet through shared experiences

### JOSH vs Meetup/Event Platforms

Event platforms: Large groups, recurring commitments, searching for the right fit  
 JOSH: Small curated groups, one-time experiences, matches come to you

### JOSH vs Messaging a Friend Group

Friend group: Limited to existing circle, coordination overhead, hesitation to suggest  
 JOSH: Expands circle naturally, coordination automated, no social anxiety

## Why This Works

Reduces Friction: One text leads to a confirmed plan with compatible people  
 Lowers Stakes: Doing something together is easier than forced "friend interviews"  
 Builds Trust: Privacy controls and graduated contact exchange create safety  
 Compounds Value: JOSH learns and improves matches over time  
 Aligns Incentives: Subscription model rewards quality connections, not engagement metrics

## One-Sentence Summary

JOSH helps you meet compatible friends by turning a simple text into a real-life LinkUp, with the coordination handled so you can just show up.
