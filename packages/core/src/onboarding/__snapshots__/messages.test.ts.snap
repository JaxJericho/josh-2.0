{
  "ONBOARDING_EXPLANATION": "Perfect. I'll walk you through how this works — a few short messages, back to back. You only need to reply to this one and the last one. Ready?",
  "ONBOARDING_LATER": "No problem. Reply Yes whenever you're ready and we'll pick up here.",
  "ONBOARDING_MESSAGES_VERSION": "v1",
  "ONBOARDING_MESSAGE_1": "My full government name is Journey of Shared Hope, but JOSH fits better as a contact name in your phone. I exist because making real friends as an adult is genuinely hard — schedules are full, social circles are set, and even when you put yourself out there it rarely turns into anything. That shouldn't be the default.",
  "ONBOARDING_MESSAGE_2": "Here's how I work. No complicated setup — just you and me in an ongoing conversation. I don't just learn what you like — I learn what it means to you. Why you like it, how it makes you feel, what a good version of it looks like. That's what actually makes the difference when I'm putting people together.",
  "ONBOARDING_MESSAGE_3": "Plans here are called LinkUps. You can start one whenever you feel like doing something — I'll find compatible people and build it around something that fits your style. And if someone else starts a plan that suits you, I'll bring you in. Either way, it's a small group of people worth meeting. Just a good reason to be in the same place as people you're likely to click with.",
  "ONBOARDING_MESSAGE_4": "That's the idea. Ready to get started?",
  "ONBOARDING_OPENING": "Call me JOSH. Nice to meet you, {firstName}. You're off the waitlist — time to find your people.

Quick heads up: a profile photo is required before I can lock in your first LinkUp. You can add it anytime through your dashboard — now or later both work. Just know it needs to be there before any plan gets confirmed. Sound good?",
